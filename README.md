# Pairs-Trading-with-Kalman-Filter
## Project Overview
Pairs trading is a market-neutral strategy in finance that capitalizes on the mean-reverting behavior of two correlated assets. When the relationship between two stocks diverges, traders can take a long-short position, betting that the two will realign. This project employs the Kalman Filter to adjust the hedge ratio dynamically, allowing for real-time trading strategy adjustments.
## Background 
The Kalman Filter is a recursive algorithm used for estimating variables of interest in real-time. In the context of pairs trading, the Kalman Filter provides an adaptive way to calculate the hedge ratio between two stocks. Instead of assuming a static relationship, the filter continuously updates this relationship as new data arrives, making it a robust tool for strategies that rely on changing market conditions.
## Project Objectives 
This project focuses on the following key objectives:

- **Understanding Pairs Trading:** Explore the theory and practice of pairs trading as a quantitative trading strategy.
- **Implementing the Kalman Filter:** Set up and implement the Kalman Filter to dynamically track and adjust hedge ratios.
- **Simulating Real-World Trading:** Apply the model to real-life stock data and simulate trades to evaluate strategy performance.
- **Avoiding Look-Ahead Bias:** Through the Bayesian nature of the Kalman Filter, ensure that the model avoids look-ahead bias and is suitable for backtesting.
##  Implementation Overview
The project consists of the following steps:

- **Data Collection:** Collect historical data for two highly correlated stocks.
- **Kalman Filter Setup:** Configure the Kalman Filter using the PyKalman library, initializing it with Bayesian parameters suitable for tracking stock relationships.
- **Real-Time Adjustment of Hedge Ratio:** Use the Kalman Filter to dynamically update the hedge ratio, ensuring the pairs trading strategy remains responsive to market changes.
- **Backtesting the Strategy:** Simulate historical pairs trading to assess the modelâ€™s effectiveness.
- **Results Analysis:** Visualize and analyze results to see how well the Kalman Filter improves the trading strategy.

## Python Libraries Used 
- **PyKalman:** For Kalman Filter implementation
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation
- **Matplotlib/Plotly:** For data visualization
- **Yahoo Finance API or yfinance library:** For obtaining stock data
